## Strategies to Python Development

Strategies:

  - Chunking and Aliasing
  - Solve a related but simpler problem 
  - Incremental development
  - Build classes independently and let inheritance discover itself
  - Repeat tasks manually until patterns emerge, the move to a function. Continue to generalize as needed.
  - Consider object orient programming as a  graph traversal problem.
  - Separate ETL from analysis. Separate analysis from presentation.
  - Verify type, verify size, view subset of data, and test a subset.
  - Humans should never gaze upon unsorted data.
  - Sets and dicts groupings are primary tools for data analysis.
  - Analysis of the Kruprekar function.
